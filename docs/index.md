# codoc data model

This site documents the structure of our open-source data model. 
It is intended to provide a clear overview of the tables, their relationships, and how they can be used in data warehouse projects. 
For more information about our broader projects and initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://www.codoc.co/fr" target="_blank">codoc</a> website.

**Work in progress**: This documentation is just getting started — some tables are not documented yet.
